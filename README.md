# Material Web - Freedom Version

It's [@mateial/web](https://github.com/material-components/material-web), but ships with no dependcies and is avaiable as a single ??kb CDN bundle.
 
There are other differences here too relating to the use of the [TAC CSS methodology](https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology)<!-- {.external} -->, which means we're leveraging existing HTML elements not recreating them.

[Material 3](https://m3.material.io/)<!-- {.external} --> is the latest version of
Google's open-source design system.

## Roadmap

**Alpha** components are in-development and may have many frequent breaking
changes.

**Beta** components are mostly polished and ready for use, but may still have
breaking changes.

**Stable** components are reviewed, documented, and API complete.
